# LINEAR-REGRESSION-DATASET
The Auto MPG dataset is a popular dataset used for regression tasks and machine learning projects. It contains information about cars, specifically their fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) and various features of the cars. It was originally used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study fuel consumption.
ðŸ“‹ Dataset Features (Columns)
Column Name	Description	Data Type
mpg	Miles per gallon (fuel efficiency - target)	Float
cylinders	Number of cylinders in the engine	Integer
displacement	Engine displacement (cubic inches)	Float
horsepower	Horsepower of the car	Float (with missing values)
weight	Weight of the car (in pounds)	Integer
acceleration	Time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph	Float
model_year	Year of the car model (last 2 digits)	Integer
origin	Origin of the car (1 = USA, 2 = Europe, 3 = Japan)	Integer
car_name	Name of the car model (e.g., "ford pinto")	String
ðŸ“ˆ Example Rows (Sample Data)

ðŸ“Œ Common Use Cases
Regression Analysis: Predicting mpg (fuel efficiency).

Feature Engineering: Analyzing how different features (e.g., weight, horsepower) affect fuel efficiency.

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (especially in the horsepower column).

Visualization: Understanding trends in car performance over time.
